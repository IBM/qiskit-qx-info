# IBM Q experience user information. 

## Organization

The qiskit-qx-info repo will contain information that will be useful to IBM Q experience users. 

The *backends* directory contains information about the different IBM Q experience backends. Initially we have uploaded the specification documents for our currently available hardware backends. Soon, we will update this to include specifications on various simulation backends. We anticipate the simulation backends to be community driven as well and welcome the inclusion of new ones that can plug into our interface!

For future research papers, we encourage the authors to reference the relevant backend specification document used, e.g. ibmqx2 or ibmqx3, with a link to the github readme file. An example reference could be style could be,

We think the device information will be an important resource and hope it helps our users understand a bit more what's going on under the covers!
